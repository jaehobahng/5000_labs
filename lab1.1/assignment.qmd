# Lab-1.1: Assignment

`Paths, command line basics, and HTML`

**Note**: We will be moving back to more "traditional" Data-science methods in the coming weeks, however, we want you to acquire the following Computer-Science fundamentals as early as possible!

## Assignment-1: Editing files with a CLI

-   The GU domains web-servers are Linux, you can "get inside" the servers with a command-line interface via a browser ![](images/2023-08-27-21-06-02.png)
-   **Note**: The GU-Domain computer is a Web-server NOT a compute-cluster. Which means that it is designed to store files and host websites, NOT for "crunching numbers" or processing large amounts of data
-   Open the terminal in the browser at <https://georgetown.domains/> (similar to the image above)
-   Modify the file `~/public_html/index.html` from the command line using the following
    -   `cd ~/`
    -   `nano ./public_html/index.html` ![](images/2023-08-27-21-23-26.png)
-   **Submission**: Take a screenshot of your webpage rendering with in the browser, similar to the following. Name it `lab-1.1.1.png` and upload it to Canvas. ![](images/2023-08-27-21-25-05.png){width="600"}

## Assignment-2: Introduction to the command line

-   Copy the following commands, ONE AT A TIME, into the terminal in the browser to explore the GU computers filesystem.

-   `Make sure you fully understand what it is doing`

-   **Notice** that you are NOT interacting with your laptop!! But rather the GU server, which is just a REMOTE computer located somewhere else in the world.

-   **Useful shortcuts:**

    -   

        (1) The `tab key` is very useful when using the command line. It will `auto-complete` commands for you

    -   

        (2) The `up and down arrows` are also useful, they let you search through previous commands

    ```         
    ls
    clear
    # comments start with the hash just like in python, this line has no effect
    ls
    # you can also put comments in-line, just like python 
    ls # this will list everything in the directory
    # the wild-card * is useful for searching for files with specific patterns
    ls *pub*
    ls -d *pub*  # -d=directories lists folders only 
    ls *pub*/*.html
    # multiple commands can be run on one line using ; to separate them
    ls *pub*; ls *pub*/*.html
    pwd
    #search for a file 
    find -name index.html
    #search for a file with a wild-card
    find -name index*
    # change current working directory to your website 
    cd public_html/
    # more,less, head, tail let you look inside of files
    more index.html
    less index.html # press q to exit
    head index.html
    tail index.html
    tail -n 4 index.html #last 4 lines
    # grep lets you search files for substrings
    grep 'Hello' index.html
    # ../ is the folder “below” you in the file tree 
    pwd ../
    ls ../
    cd ../
    # ./ is the current folder you are in 
    ls ./
    cd public_html/
    pwd ./
    # ~/ is an alias for the path /home/jfhgeorg
    cd ~/ 
    pwd
    cd public_html/
    # Make a new folder 
    mkdir files
    ls
    cd files
    # Make a blank file
    > page2.html
    ls
    # Copy a file
    cp ../index.html  ./page3.html
    more page2.html
    more page3.html
    pwd
    # Look at the computers CPU information
    cat /proc/cpuinfo 
    history
    ```

-   **Submission**: After running all the commands, simply copy all the text from the terminal (outputs and commands) and save it to a plain text file named `Lab-1.1.2.txt`, upload it to Canvas.

## Assignment-3: A simple website {.smaller}

-   Use the following download as a starting point for a simple `HTML` website, built "from scratch" (i.e. without Quarto):
    -   [Click here to download](simple-website-template.zip)
-   **Do the following**;
    -   Open the `html` files in VS-code to edit them, and open the same files in a browser to see the rendered result (refresh the webpage to see changes)
    -   rename the folder "my_website"
    -   Replace the penguin with a picture of yourself stored in `my_website/images/photo.png` (make sure it renders on the webpage)
    -   Write a Paragraph to replace the `About me` section with information about yourself.
    -   Replace the `Academic Interests` and `Education` section with information about yourself
    -   Demonstrate knowledge of the various `HTML` constructs by customizing the file `website-template/pages/html-cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html` with your own content, feel free to use `Lorem Ipsum` placeholder text to accelerate the process. (<https://loremipsum.io/>)
    -   Include the image in `my_website/images/photo.png` in the webpage `website-template/pages/html-cheatsheet/cheatsheet.html`
        -   Use `relative paths`, NOT `absolute paths` and DON'T make a copy of the `photo.png` file.\
-   **Submission**: When done, compress the folder `my_website` and upload the compressed version to Canvas
